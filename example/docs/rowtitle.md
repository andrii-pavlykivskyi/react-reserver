import RowTitle from '../src/examples/RowTitle'

So we want to give each column a title, it could be a date or time. 
In this example I use the library [moment](https://momentjs.com/) in order to generate the array of dates but you can use any library you want or you can just use a static array. 

Click on a title to see what happens!

<RowTitle />

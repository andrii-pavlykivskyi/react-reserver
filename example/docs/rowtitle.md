import RowTitle from '../src/examples/RowTitle'

How about giving each row a title. Maybe it represents a room, a vehicle or person. 
So here we are going to create a list of people so we can assign their work times

<RowTitle />

We are going to use the prop rowTitles which takes an array or a function that returns an array. 
The function 

```jsx {28-54,57-62,95} file=../src/examples/RowTitle.js
```

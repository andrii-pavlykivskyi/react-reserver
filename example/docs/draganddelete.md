import DragBar from '../src/examples/DragBar'

The bar is very versatile in this example we enable dragging and deleting of the bar.
- Create a bar by clicking and dragging across the grid.
- right click the bar and select 'enable drag'
- start dragging

This is not the most beautiful way to do dragging. I'll be adding a better example later on. 

In order to delete, right click and hit delete

<DragBar />

```jsx  file=../src/examples/DragBar.js
```

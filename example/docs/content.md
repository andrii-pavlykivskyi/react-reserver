import Content from '../src/examples/Content'

This is kinda a crazy example but I think it illustrates the solution pretty well. 
You might want to have different content in the grid. maybe its a different color that denotes a more desireable date or maybe there are prices in each cell allowing the reserver to know how much is being payed for each day/hour. either way you want to control what appears inside. 

In this example I select a random cell and insert a random number with a random color.

<Content />


```jsx file=../src/examples/Content.js
```

id: content
title: Grid Content
sidebar_label: Grid Content

This is kinda a crazy example but I think it illustrates the solution pretty well. 
You might want to have different content in the grid. maybe its a different color that denotes a more desireable date or maybe there are prices in each cell allowing the reserver to know how much is being payed for each day/hour. either way you want to control what appears inside. 

In this example I select a random cell and insert a random number with a random color.

 <iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/grid-content-s0ogg?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&view=preview"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
    height: 500,
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: 4,
    overflow: "hidden"
  }}
  title="Grid Content"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
/>;



```jsx file=../src/examples/Content.js
```
